Written by:  <ul class="inline mx-0 list-none"> <li class="inline"> <a href="/deepworld-2025-website/blog/authors/boraini"> Mert Bora İnevi  </a> </li> </ul> </div> <p>Today, after months of work, Deepworld works as great as the good old days. However, we can’t provide an experience as smooth as the old game, since we are having trouble negotiating with the original devs to use the same domain names or to make a lot of updates to the client. This forces us to mod the game client that is published on Steam and provide a zip download link to it, instead of just allowing players to use the Steam release of the game as-is.</p>
<h1 id="how-to-play">How to Play</h1>
<p>Simply download the zip file provided through the Download Client button <a href="/deepworld-2025-website/">on the home page</a>. Unzip it and run the .exe file.</p>
<p>This version of the game differs from the stock Steam way in a few small but important ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardcoded API endpoint URLs are changed to point to the live server BrainWine host instead of the original Deepworld API, where the latter is what was “shut down” in 2019.</li>
<li>A lot of item and block textures have been updated to make the art style of the game more consistent. We have chosen to adopt the latest art style of the game, so not the hatched style. There are some plans to make a client with the hatched textures maybe.</li>
<li>Some features available in the iOS/MacOS client but missing on Unity client versions have been added, such as conveyor belt physics.</li>
<li>Some quality-of-life features have been added, such as a display of the crowns given by a quest alongside the XP given.</li>
<li>Support for mining the base layer (upcoming).</li>
<li>and many more…</li>
</ul>
<p>We can assure that no telemetry has been implemented into the client and any existing telemetry code doesn’t function anymore. We aren’t benefitting out of this much other than the gratitude of the Deepworld fans.</p>
<h1 id="starting-off">Starting Off</h1>
<p>Your initial gaming activity will involve making some achievement such as Spelunker and Lumberjack to quickly gain XP and level up. You can also gain a lot of XP by crafting items. Then, you will use your skill points (one gained per level) to level up different skills. It has been suggested that you spend your initial skill points on your mining, engineering, and stamina skills, then you proceed with survival, building skills.</p>
<p>You can view the Skills menu by clicking the top left profile button and going to the corresponding tab.</p>
<p>In your early days in the game, getting scammed is an essential part of life. That is how you get hazed into the community. We still did it better than the game called Growtopia.</p>
<p>UPDATE FALL 2025: Now, we have this entire system called bartering. Visit your local Bert android to get access to a marketplace and scrap market where you can trade items for shillings, even when there aren’t many players to trade with!</p>
<h1 id="contribute">Contribute</h1>
<p>We are looking for programmers good at Java/C# and object-oriented programming, who will help us improve and expand the server and client for the 2025 reincarnation of the game. Check out the relevant GitHub repositories on the front page and check out the issues to start collaborating today!</p> </main>   <script type="module">const l=document.getElementsByClassName("parallax")[0];addEventListener("scroll",e=>{l.style.backgroundPositionY=-window.scrollY/8+"px"});</script></body></html>
